## Methodology

## Material

## Observations
During the experiment, the participants will experience a new command called "GITS SYNC" that resolve the merge conflict situation when they push to the GitHub repository. It is important to know the participant's level of mastery on the Git commands. Also, we want to compare what the participants think to solve merge conflict in the traditional way v.s. GITS SYNC.

## Analysis

## Conclusion
1. All the participants have faced merge conflict issue while using GIT and nearly all the participants find it difficult to fix merge conflict.
2. 90% Participants found it easy to install our project.
3. All the participants found it very easy to fix merge conflict using "GITS SYNC" command of our project as they didn't have to go through the manual and time consuming process of fixing those merge conflicts. Participants are likely to recommend this feature of our project to others.

## Threats to Validity
There are a few things in our experiment which could be improved to have a clearer and more accurate statistics. Following are some highlights -

1. The candidates were using different machines with different configurations, and different network connections. Even though we tried to maintain the same environment by using Linux(locally or via VCL), the latency and speed factors still could affect the experience in subtle but important ways.  
2. The familiarity of different candidates with GIT was not considered to be equal. So if we ask if they would recommend this, the answers can vary because of different levels of comfort with GIT.  
3. There were some additional modules needed in python, this can create bias pertaining to the familiarity of python. The experiment would be longer for someone who doesn't have the compiler or even the package manager installed. This could affect the user feedback.  
4. The project stresses on some specific parts of GIT, especially the merge conflict. Someone who has likely experienced the worst of it would definitely give a better review and analysis, as compared to someone who rarely experienced it.  
5. The candidate's review is captured based on some fixed scales, and not given much room for subjective review. Due to this, some of the aspects are not examined in very detail regarding the review.
